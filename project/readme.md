## Course project: literature review 
 
### Objectives

The project requires you to write a literature review describing a methodological topic in the design or analysis of epidemiological studies that is motivated by the readings in HSCI 805 (textbook and class presentations).   

At the end of the term, your literature review will be describing "state of the art" methodologies. For example, what is the state of the research on how to estimate direct and indirect effects in a mediation analysis?  

There are two deliverables for this assignment:
1. Literature review proposal -  See syllabus for dates when due.
2. Final report - See syllabus for dates when due.

### Choosing a topic

[Topics that you may choose for your literature review](topics.md) 

Constraints:
- Please confirm your choice with the instructor.  
- At most one (no exceptions) group of students can work on each topic. 
- Each topic will be chosen on a first come first serve basis.


### Deliverable 1: Literature review proposal 

This should be an overview of your topic (+ references e.g. 2nd page) and will be used to gain feedback.  

#### Constraints:
1. Length: no more than two pages (exclude the list of references) 
2. It should have a working title and then include a paragraph that clearly states the topic of your literature review, e.g. 

   > "For my review, I will write about the challenges of measuring exposure to air pollution in occupational epidemiology studies of respiratory illness in North American sawmill workers"

   > "My review will discuss the problem of missing data in prospective studies of gay men in Vancouver (e.g. men who are lost to follow-up and how this impacts results)"

3. The literature review proposal should include a paragraph that briefly describes a specific real-life example of a health research study where 
4. the methodological problem was present.  Finally, your interim report should include at least 2 solid references that focus specifically on methodology.  
5. The references must be journal articles and cannot be textbooks. Use the reference format for American Journal of Epidemiology.


### Deliverable 2: Final report 

Constraints:
- A title page
- Length: no more than 5000 words 
- Include as many tables, figures, references as you need to reinforce your messages.
- Include the following sections:  
   > **Introduction**: A description of the methodological problem.  For example "Ecological bias is a big problem in health research.  It occurs when we falsely conclude that ecological-level association apply at the individual-level.".  The introduction could describe the history of the methodological problem.  So for example, "Ecological bias has long been a problem in health research.  Dating from 19XX, so and so wrote that we need to worry about the ecologic fallacy and they suggested XXX".  Additionally, you might want to talk about the public health implications (e.g. epidemiologists reaching wrong conclusions and confusing the public).  For example, concerning the ecological association between dietary fat consumption and breast cancer:  A spurious association may lead to a health scare where people are needlessly told to avoid certain diets because they may cause cancer.

   > **Illustration**: It is often useful to describe a real-life health research study where the methodological was present. Try to show how authors came to an erroneous conclusion.  This section of the report should be quite detailed in order to vividly illustrate the methodological problem.

   > **Review of solutions**: Give a review of what people have suggested for solving the methodological problem.  So for example, if you are writing about exposure assessment in environmental epi, then you might write about various strategies for measuring and validating exposure measurements.  Or if you are writing about publication bias in systematic reviews, then you could talk about funnel plots and efforts to make editorial process more transparent.  Or if you were talking about missing data, then you might talk about efforts to pre-screen participants in order to minimize loss to follow up or about multiple imputation.

- References: Use the reference format for American Journal of Epidemiology.   

- The final report must include at least twenty (20) references of which all are published journal articles or books.  Internet reports and references are discouraged.

### Grading

Your report will be graded based on a letter grade.  

| Grade| Description |
|--|--|
| A+ | The letter grade of A+ is reserved for the most exceptional work that greatly exceeds course expectations. |  
| A | A very high level of  performance on all criteria used for evaluation. Contributions deserving an A are distinguished in virtually every aspect. They show that the report significantly shows initiative, creativity, insight, and probing analysis. Further, the achievement must show careful attention to term paper requirements of completeness, presentation and quality of research.|  
| A- | These are awarded for very high quality of performance, no  problems of any significance, and fulfillment of all term paper requirements in terms of completeness, presentation and quality of research.  |
| B+ ||
| B  ||
| B- ||

In accordance with FHS grading policy, it is anticipated that at most 15% of students will receive a grade of A+ and that the median letter grade will be A or A-.  

The literature review is worth ____ of the final grade for HSCI 805.  Grades will assign equal weight to each of the following:

- Completeness whether the report has all required elements that are detailed above.
- Presentation including: quality of writing, references, formatting, spelling and organization.
- Quality of Research including: originality/creativity, breadth of literature review, completeness, organization of ideas and thinking.
